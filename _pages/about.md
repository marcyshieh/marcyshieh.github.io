My name is Marcy Shieh and I am a PhD Candidate at the Department of Political Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I study American politics with a concentration in judicial politics. My research interests include judicial elections, judicial selection methods, judicial decision-making, campaigns, text analysis, and survey experiments.

I graduated from the University of California, Davis with a BA in political science and philosophy with a minor in statistics in 2014. Prior to graduate school, I worked at a healthcare policy firm as a senior project management coordinator.

In my spare time, I like hanging out with my cat, eating and cooking food, and watching films and television.
