<img align="left" width="50%" and height="50%" style="padding: 10px; float: left;" src="files/IMG_3326.jpeg"> My name is Marcy Shieh. I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science at Miami University in Ohio. 

I study American politics with a concentration in judicial politics. My research interests include state supreme courts, federal courts, and the criminal justice system more broadly. I apply methods, such as text analysis and survey experiments, to conduct my work. My work has been published or is forthcoming in *Research & Politics*, *Political Research Quarterly*, *Social Science Quarterly*, *Open Judicial Politics*, and the *Research Handbook of Judicial Politics*.

I received my PhD in political science from the University of Wisconsin--Madison in 2023. I graduated from the University of California, Davis with a BA in political science and philosophy with a minor in statistics in 2014. Prior to graduate school, I worked as a technical project coordinator at a healthcare policy firm. I was Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Political Science and Public Administration at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte during the 2023-2024 school year. 

In my spare time, I like hanging out with my cat, eating and cooking food, and watching films and television.
