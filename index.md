My name is Marcy Shieh. I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I study American politics with a concentration in judicial politics. In particular, my primary research interest is state supreme court elections. My dissertation examines different facets of state supreme court elections, including whether policy information prevents ballot roll-off, whether types of journalism attracts public interests, and whether campaign finance regulations influence the justice's voting and opinion-writing strategies. I use a variety of methodologies, such as survey experiments and text analysis. I have experience teaching courses on survey research, research design, statistical computing, introduction to American government, and the U.S. Supreme Court.
